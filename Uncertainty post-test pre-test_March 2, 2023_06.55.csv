I'm Dr. Paula Szewach, a researcher at the University of Essex, and I would like to invite you to participate in a survey. 

 

The purpose of the survey is to find out how people feel about new COVID-19 vaccines. We are a team of academic researchers interested in public opinion and how people make decisions. We have no agenda to persuade people either way on the issue and are not connected to any public health body or vaccine manufacturer.



The survey will take about 5 minutes to complete. If you complete it, your Prolific account will be credited with £0.75.



By clicking onward into the survey, you confirm that you have read the details above and that you agree with the following:  


	I understand that my participation is voluntary and that I am free to withdraw from the survey at any time without giving any reason and without penalty
	I understand that the data from this project will be used for the purposes of academic research, including publications in print or online
	I understand that those data will be fully anonymous and confidential: no identifying information will be collected and publications will only ever report summary data (e.g. the average opinion in a given age group, not the opinion of any given individual)
	I give permission for my anonymised answers to be deposited in a research data archive so that they will be available for future research and learning activities by other individuals




The study has been approved by the Ethics Committee at the University of Essex (Ethics ETH2223-0839). If you have any concerns about any aspect of the study or you have a complaint, in the first instance please contact me at p.szewach@essex.ac.uk. If you are still concerned, please contact the University’s Research Governance and Planning Manager, Sarah Manning-Press (sarahm@essex.ac.uk).
